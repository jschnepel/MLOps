# Session state

**Specification:** OPS-BUILD-1.3.6 (`BUILD_SPEC.md` + `SPEC_AMENDMENTS.md`)
**Current milestone:** M00 (baseline, sealed holdout intents and model probe)
**Next task:** execute Plan A (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-07-first-slice-a-baseline-workspace.md`): T01 (agent) and T03 (owner, off-machine) in parallel, then T02 (after the seal), T42, T04, T06.
**Repository:** local git repo at `C:\Users\joeys\Desktop\MLOps`, branch `main`. Remote `github.com/jschnepel/MLOps` (public, MIT) **not created yet**: the GitHub CLI is installed but the owner hasn't logged in (`gh auth login`). Nothing has been pushed.

## Done in the planning session (2026-10-06)

- **Imported the handoff unmodified** (commit "Import Operations Copilot build handoff…"). In place, `scripts/verify_handoff.py --manifest --reference-code` passed with 161 checksums and 19 reference files.
- **Ran the reference recovery CLI** locally: OUTCOME_UNKNOWN → reconcile → one incident.
- **Could not run the 58-test reference suite here.** Collection failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi`. An isolated `uv run --with …` attempt was blocked by tool permission. This is the first thing T01 must do.
- **Ran an adversarial review** with six independent reviewers plus a lead spot-check: `docs/reviews/handoff-review-2026-10-06.md`.
- **The owner approved "amend + cut".** Wrote:
  - `SPEC_AMENDMENTS.md`;
  - `docs/adr/ADR-0001-*` (top-level directory per service);
  - `docs/adr/ADR-0002-*` (v1 scope cut; single-writer checkpoint profile);
  - the regenerated `handoff/tasks.json` (35 tasks as a graph);
  - `handoff/acceptance-matrix.json` (100 requirements, re-homed, R081–R100 added);
  - `handoff/BUILD_BACKLOG.md`;
  - an MIT `LICENSE`.
- After those edits, `scripts/verify_handoff.py` (structure checks) passes: 35 acyclic tasks, 100 covered requirements. **`--manifest` no longer passes**, because the edited files intentionally differ from the delivered snapshot (BUILD_SPEC §0 anticipates this). The original snapshot is preserved in git commit 1.
- Added `.gitattributes` (LF) so fixture and manifest hashes survive Windows checkouts.

## Second review and 1.2 revision (2026-10-06)

- Ran a second adversarial review with four fresh reviewers: `docs/reviews/plan-review-2026-10-06.md`.
- The owner approved the 1.2 update. Rewrote `SPEC_AMENDMENTS.md` (1.2). The main changes:
  - the MCP server records the attempt protocol through hardened definer functions;
  - fenced writes lock the lease row and use `clock_timestamp()`;
  - `durability="sync"` plus a stored checkpoint ID;
  - one destination `action_key` table;
  - one grant per run, ever;
  - a revocation mechanism;
  - a custom MCP `TokenVerifier`;
  - one worker replica in v1;
  - evaluation statistics;
  - schema alignment assigned to T07.
- Revised ADR-0002 (effort is now 54–108 days, unmeasured).
- Regenerated `handoff/tasks.json`: 40 tasks, renumbered, now including a walking skeleton, dev bootstrap and early CI. Regenerated the acceptance matrix: 117 requirements, all with a test path.
- `scripts/verify_handoff.py` passes the structure checks. A cross-reference check found no unknown task or requirement IDs in the amendments or ADRs.
- **Schemas, examples and fixtures are deliberately still at 1.0.** T07 updates them under contract tests (AM-80, R104).

## Third review and 1.3 revision (2026-10-06)

- Ran round 3 with three fresh reviewers: `docs/reviews/plan-review-r3-2026-10-06.md`. It found 14 items that block starting T01–T08; the rest were LATER items.
- Updated to `SPEC_AMENDMENTS.md` 1.3:
  - AM-00 lists the superseded BUILD_SPEC passages;
  - abort carries the grant hash, and a POST onto an aborted key returns the tombstone;
  - `mark_sent` re-checks cancellation;
  - an audited ABANDONED_UNVERIFIED operator exit from ESCALATED;
  - the conversation-slot rule on revision;
  - the draft `question` field and a completed AM-80;
  - the reference moves in T04, plus a traceability map in T07;
  - checker updates;
  - the holdout is split (T03 seals intents, T41 adds gold labels), with the seal recorded externally;
  - the probe uses ≥30 distinct inputs in an isolated environment;
  - `seed-ids.json` and the Keycloak topology;
  - the walking skeleton's processes are named and it uses real tokens;
  - the venv lives outside the repo;
  - LangGraph resume rules verified against the 1.2.14 source;
  - the asset-guard advisory lock;
  - corrected evaluation power (only ~30-point differences are detectable at n≈25).
- `handoff/tasks.json`: 41 tasks (T41 appended), with LATER items attached as `review_notes`. The acceptance matrix has 123 requirements. The critical path is 15 tasks: T01→T04→T05→T08→T09→T13→T15→T16→T20→T21→T22→T26→T27→T33→T34.
- `verify_handoff.py` structure checks pass, as does a cross-reference check of the amendments and ADRs.
- **Process change:** no more spec-wide review rounds. Review happens per slice, against code and tests.

## Round 5 (spec-wide) and 1.3.2 (2026-10-06)

- Ran a spec-wide review with four fresh reviewers: `docs/reviews/plan-review-r5-2026-10-06.md`. No critical findings, about 35 new.
- The owner chose to **keep hardening** (option a).
- 1.3.2 fixes S1–S9 and H1–H5:
  - **S1:** README, START_HERE and KICKOFF_PROMPT corrected (precedence, no Kubernetes claim, current counts).
  - **S2:** a job-type table.
  - **S3:** the tombstone shape and a permanent REJECTED key.
  - **S4:** asset-guard refusals → BLOCKED_REVIEW.
  - **S5:** `state_version` changes only on transitions.
  - **S6:** a shared reason enum.
  - **S7:** sweeper and operator roles; the operator CLI is no longer on migrator.
  - **S8:** MANIFEST is a frozen 1.0 snapshot.
  - **S9:** localhost-bound ports, model digest check, secrets outside the repo.
  - **H1:** role × table privilege matrix.
  - **H2:** read definer functions for MCP.
  - **H3:** a second incident is blocked (**owner decision**).
  - **H5:** the test clock is a test-profile-only table.
- Other round-5 items are attached as task `review_notes`.
- My 1.3.1 edit had introduced a CR-escape bug. Fixed in `b09b08f`.
- **Ollama network exposure (owner decision):** restrict to loopback plus the Docker/WSL subnet. **Observed now:** `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`, with firewall rules allowing `ollama.exe` inbound from any address on Public and Private profiles. T05 writes `docs/runbooks/ollama-network.md` for the owner to apply; the agent changes no system settings.
- Checks: `verify_handoff.py` passes (41 tasks, 126 requirements); cross-references resolve; critical path 15 tasks; no CR bytes.

## Round 6 and 1.3.3 (2026-10-06)

- Round 6 (`docs/reviews/plan-review-r6-2026-10-06.md`): 3 of 14 round-5 items closed, 11 partial; 6 high findings, all in text 1.3.2 added. The owner chose a full prose round that rewrites the privilege matrix and function contracts first.
- **1.3.3:** AM-20 rewritten as exact column-level grants (AM-20.2), a function-contract table with callers, inputs, locks, transitions and events (AM-20.3), job dedup keys (AM-20.4), explicit RLS policies incl. `app_definer` (AM-20.5), and the test clock as an Alembic branch (AM-20.6). Append-only state rows replace UPDATEs on audit tables. `GRANT EXECUTE` goes only to named callers. REJECTED is in every destination sentence. The asset guard refuses any overlapping committed incident regardless of timing unless `supersedes_run_id` names it (**owner decision**). `data/model-pins.json` written by T02 and checked by T19 (R127). R128: every transition and event via a definer function.
- **Mistake found and fixed:** commit `61cc504` was not byte-identical to the delivered package (`.gitignore`). The package zip is now committed as `provenance/handoff-1.0.zip` and `--manifest` will verify against it (T42).
- Task splits: T04 → T04 + T42; T05 → T05 + T43 + T44; T07 → T07 + T45 + T46. 46 tasks, 128 requirements, critical path 15.
- `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` added: the problems found across all rounds and what changed, for portfolio readers.

## Round 8, 1.3.6 and Plan A (2026-10-07)

- Round 8 (`docs/reviews/plan-review-r8-2026-10-07.md`): 8 of 10 round-7 items closed; 1.3.5 had 2 high regressions (`create_run` had no tenant source; `freeze_proposal` had no payload) and 4 medium; **Plan A was not executable** (nine blocking defects, all reproduced by a builder dry-run on scratch copies: the hashes file is a dict, the reference conftest above the new tests, `--all-packages`, ruff on pinned files, a backslash-n in a test, PowerShell BOM+CRLF, in-tree `build/`, a thinning rule that dropped three scenarios).
- **1.3.6:** `create_run(tenant_id, …)`; `freeze_proposal(run_id, draft_id, payload)` verified against `drafts.draft_sha256`; status answers and conversation clarifications are messages, not events; the sweeper iterates tenants; `clarify` after the active-run check; `ABORT_REQUESTED` in the attempt-state enum; T42 now precedes T04.
- **Plan A rewritten** in the order T01, T03, T02, T42, T04, T06, with every "Expected" line stating only what the step's command prints, generators writing their own LF files, a model unload before the cold call, an AST cross-import test, a clean-clone sync step, and the full checker tail shown. Plans B and C are written after Plan A executes and are dry-run before execution.

## 1.3.5 (2026-10-07): round-7 fixes

- `docs/reviews/plan-review-r7-2026-10-07.md`: 10 of 13 round-6 items closed; 5 high, all in 1.3.3/1.3.4 text; the `session_user` mechanism verified sound.
- Fixes: `supersedes_run_id` and `intent` are requester-asserted fields on `runs`, injected by `freeze_proposal`, rejected in drafts; `transition_run` is worker-only with pre-grant targets; `create_run` creates runs (∅ → QUEUED row); seeds via `migrator` `BYPASSRLS`; `sweeper_all` policies; `revoke_handles`; `record_status_answer`; `clock_offset`; `set_config(…, true)`; admission `clarify` route (R018 kept); `action.granted`/`action.redispatched` owners; `deliver_outbox` job type.
- Showcase corrected: "Planned proof", "Where the code will live (not yet written)", the graph redrawn from the ten-route table with interrupts marked, host-side Ollama stated, a "Not claimed" block, README "Target tests" and limit sentences. PROJECT_HISTORY round attributions corrected against the review files and the author's mistakes listed.
- 47 tasks, 131 requirements.

## 1.3.4 (2026-10-07): showcase

- Owner direction: the project must properly show least privilege, routers, orchestrators and MCPs. ADR-0003.
- New AM-16 (admission router, graph router node, model router; R129, R130). MCP server split into `mcp-read` (role `mcp_read`, 3 functions) and `mcp-write` (role `mcp_exec`, 6 functions) with disjoint handles and audiences (R131); T15 = mcp-read, new T47 = mcp-write; T08 runs both.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` maps the four concepts to components, requirement IDs and demos; the README has a "What this demonstrates" table.
- 47 tasks, 131 requirements.

## Walking-skeleton debt list (T08; committed before coding) [R6-B7]

Allowed shortcuts in T08, each with its owning task:
- single owner DB role, no AM-20.2 grants, no RLS → T09;
- both MCP servers run but with the single owner DB role (their function-only roles arrive in T09; the server split itself is NOT debt);
- plain INSERTs and UPDATEs instead of `transition_run`, `append_event`, `record_decision`, `freeze_proposal`, `grant_execution`, `mark_sent`, `record_outcome`, `resolve_invocation` → T09/T13/T22;
- no `app.current_time()` / test clock → T09;
- no lease, fence, heartbeat or model permit → T13;
- no idempotency keys, outbox or `next_event_seq` lock → T14;
- no asset guard or expiry → T12/T21;
- raw handle not hashed → T09/T15;
- fake model → T19; no LangGraph or durability → T20.

Not debt (must be real in T08): client-credentials tokens from T05; aud/azp/iss checks in mcp-read, mcp-write and incident-sim; `action_key` ON CONFLICT; a decision step by a second persona; every transition routed through T07's table.

## Environment (observed)

## Owner decisions recorded

- Portfolio/learning purpose; synthetic data only.
- Keycloak for identity.
- Local `qwen3:8b`.
- Every failure category proven by tests.
- Separate-services architecture.
- MIT license; publish publicly to `jschnepel/MLOps` once logged in.

## Open owner inputs

- `gh auth login`, then approval to push.
- Review of OPS-BUILD-1.2, then the implementation plan for M00–M01.
- T03: the owner writes about 25 holdout case intents without AI help, keeps them off-machine, and records the seal hash externally before T02.
- T06: decide whether to publish early (public repo at M01) or start private and make it public at T34.

## Exact next step

Execute Plan A, starting with T01:

```powershell
uv venv "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ops-ref-venv" --python 3.13
uv pip install --python "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ops-ref-venv" ".[web,test]"   # not -e: T04 moves the code (re-create the venv from reference/ afterwards)
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ops-ref-venv\Scripts\python" -m pytest -q
```
